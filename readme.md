# Gesture Recogination Myo

This project aims to perform prediction of gestures captured by Myo, from the data generated by an I.A. predicts which gesture the user wishes to perform.
## Getting Started

The database used to perform the predictions per second of each gesture will be the information generated by Myo instantly, where it will be aggregated per second.
### Prerequisites

The python used for development was 3.6.5.
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
pandas==0.23.2
numpy==1.14.5
scikit-learn==0.19.1
pickle==0.7.4
myo-python==1.0.3
matplotlib==2.2.2
collections
time

```

### Installing

To run this application you sould create a new virtualenv and install all the dependencies described below. If you prefer, you can use the requirements.txt included in this project to install all the dependencies on one single command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You must install and connect the Myo device with its operating system, so this connection is important so that the myo-python package to see the device.

## Deployment

If you follow a sequence until you perform the predictions of the user's gestures, they are:
```
1. Calibration Process: For each user it is necessary to collect 30 seconds of each gesture. (Collect_data_final.py)

2. Preprocessing and modeling process: In this step, the data simulation process for the training will be performed and the 30 seconds collected will be used for testing. (Process_Model.py)

3. Gesture prediction: Here the prediction per second of each gesture performed by the user according to the model is already performed. (Predict_data_Myo.py)
```
The gestures defined were:

```
Ok -  üëå
Cool - üëÜ
Fist - ‚úä
Open Hands - ü§ö
PeaceandLove - ‚úå
Indicator -  ‚òù

```
## Versioning

We are now on the development. As soon as we have a closed version, a tag should be created to hold the version 1.0 .
